# Readme  

## Background
This project is both a record of my growth and a garden to plant dream.

It is rooted on Flask framework, due to the flexibility and strong community that Flask possesses.

## Coding conventions
### 1.PEP8
Python development usually follows PEP8 style guide. Considering it is tedious to remember every rule, lint packages are helpful.
In this project, PyCharm is used as an IDE, where option + command + L could be used to format the codings.

### 2.Annotation
Python is fulled with dynamic programming, while it is convenient to add python annotation to communicate among programmers, if you are using python 3.

### 3.Imports
Absolute import is highly recommended, since it is more human readable and supported by PEP8.

## Virtual Environment
### 1.Virtualenv
It is a popular third-party tool to apply a virtual environment in a project.
### 2.Pipenv
It is a younger tool to try.
### 3.Pyenv
It is supported by python, and much powerful in isolating python environment.
